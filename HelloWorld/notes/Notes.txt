Spring boot app can be created by 3 ways

1.Eclipse maven proj
2.STS
3.SPRING INITIALIZER (website)

can be run on 2 ways :

1. thorough IDE
2.SPRING CLI (command line interface)

Running on CLI
--------------
1.Unzip the downloaded
2.set a path for SPRING CLI up to bin folder
3.create a groovy file and copy the controller code to grovvy file..(we can remove all the import in groovy file)
4.run file using command
  spring run filename.groovy


What is groovy used for?
It can be used as both a programming language and a scripting language for the Java Platform, 
is compiled to Java virtual machine (JVM) bytecode, and interoperates seamlessly with other Java code 
and libraries. Groovy uses a curly-bracket syntax similar to Java's.


cons of spring boot
------------
1.migration effort -migrating from old spring to new spring boot proj is not straight forward.it mostly for
  new development projects

2.Deployment to other servers is bit difficult with downgrading some version and removing jars

3.spring mostly focuses on micro services and cloud native.not other areas
